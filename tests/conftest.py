"""Shared test wiring.

The one rule here: a unit test must never read live system state. The
0.9.3 audit found a guard that was dead code against the real
compositor while its tests passed happily on fabricated fixtures, so
anything that touches the machine gets neutralized by default and a
test that wants the interesting state opts in explicitly.
