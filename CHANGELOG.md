All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- `hypruse init`: registers the server in detected MCP clients (per-client
  confirmation, timestamped config backup, never overwrites an existing
  entry), then runs doctor. `hypruse doctor`: one-command diagnostics for
  dependencies, session discovery, the event socket, a virtual-pointer
  handshake, and a live capture.
- `binds` tool: the user's keybinds decoded to combos with descriptions,
  so agents drive the desktop through its owner's own shortcuts.
- `wait_for` tool: block on real compositor events (window open/close,
  workspace change, title change) with a match filter and timeout.
- Read-only mode: `HYPRUSE_READONLY=1` exposes only observation tools.

### Changed
- `launch` now subscribes to the Hyprland event socket before dispatching
  and blocks on the actual openwindow event (polling remains as fallback).
- Console entry point moved to `hypruse.cli:main`; bare `hypruse` still
  runs the stdio server, so existing client registrations keep working.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- Docs, docstrings, and package metadata use plain ASCII punctuation; em
  and en dashes removed throughout.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Ctrl+C no longer hangs with a "could not acquire lock for stdin at
  interpreter shutdown" fatal: the beacon's SIGINT handler was fighting the
  MCP/anyio runtime's own shutdown. SIGINT is now left to the runtime (the
  beacon is still cleaned up via `atexit`); only SIGTERM is handled.

### Added
- Running `hypruse` directly in a terminal now prints what it is and how to
  register it, then exits, instead of silently blocking as a stdio server
  waiting for a client that will never connect.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

Initial release.

### Added
- MCP stdio server with six tools: `desktop`, `screenshot`, `pointer`,
  `keyboard`, `hypr`, `launch`, plus cross-tool guidance in the server
  `instructions` and terse per-tool schemas for eager client loading.
- Semantic desktop snapshot over hyprctl IPC (token-lean, fixture-tested).
- Screenshots via grim: focused monitor, exact window crop, region zoom,
  with true output dimensions and scale for exact pixel→global mapping.
  Default returns a saved PNG path (works with hosts that mangle inline
  image blocks); `HYPRUSE_SCREENSHOT_MODE=image` returns wire-level image
  content auto-fit to a transport byte budget and long-edge cap
  (`HYPRUSE_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, `HYPRUSE_MAX_IMAGE_EDGE`) by degrading format
  before resolution, so the API never silently downscales under the model.
  Coarse-to-fine clicking guidance to counter pixel-estimation error.
- Pointer input over a raw `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` wire client, no
  ydotool, no uinput, no daemon; positioning via `hyprctl movecursor`.
- Keyboard input via wtype (XKB keymap upload; unicode/layout-correct),
  with combo parsing (`ctrl+shift+t`, `super+enter`, bare-mod taps).
- Workspace/window dispatchers and app launch with new-window detection,
  including single-instance apps (browsers) whose window is relocated to
  the requested workspace.
- Session discovery: finds `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` / `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
  from runtime sockets when the host launches the server with a stripped
  environment (dbus/systemd-activated desktop apps).
- Activity beacon + Waybar kill-switch indicator module.
- Unit suite, seat-safe live e2e, MCP stdio round-trip tests, supervised
  input verification script, CI.
